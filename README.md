In the modern digital era, healthcare services are increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence to
enhance accessibility and efficiency. This project presents the development of an intelligent Healthcare
Chatbot designed to provide users with a preliminary disease prediction based on their described
symptoms.
The chatbot utilizes a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a
machine learning model (Decision Tree Classifier) to extract relevant symptoms from user input and
predict possible diseases. The NLP component, powered by a sentence transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2),
maps free-text descriptions to known medical symptoms, while the backend machine learning model
processes these symptoms to make a diagnosis. Additionally, the chatbot offers relevant disease
descriptions, suggested precautions, and natural cures sourced from curated datasets. The web interface,
built using Flask, ensures a user-friendly interaction platform. This solution demonstrates the potential
of AI to support initial medical screening and health awareness, especially in underserved areas or for
preliminary health consultation.
This intelligent Healthcare Chatbot represents a significant step toward democratizing access to basic
health information, especially benefiting individuals in underserved or remote regions where immediate
medical consultation may not be readily available. By providing timely, accurate, and informative
responses, the system demonstrates the profound potential of AI-driven technologies in supporting
initial medical screenings, raising health awareness, and ultimately contributing to better public health
outcomes.
